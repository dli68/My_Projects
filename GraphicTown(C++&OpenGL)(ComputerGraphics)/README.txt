Specifications:

ps: higher than 90% of objects have lightings set up well; the city has been carefully planned out.

1. Particle System 
- able to rain and snow.
- the particle amount can be adjusted.
- the particle behavior can be affected by wind.
- the system is carefully tuned up such that the particles are well distributed.

2. Helicopter (behavior, spinning)
- able to rotate and the rotate speed is adjustable.
- the top blade follows the physical rule that edges of blades drop lower than the rest based on rotate speed.

3. Street Tree (billboard, 4-channel texturing)
- a variety of tree types
- the selection and distribution of trees are carefully implemented.

4. art museum (curved surface, non-flat surface texturing)
- carefully selected pictures and tune-ups.

5. highrise & apartments (i.e. basic streetview) (4-channel texturing, non-flat surface texturing)
- carefully selected pictures and tune-ups.

6. traffic (behavior)
- cars can stop at stop signs and wait for cars in the front.

7. Wind system (behavior)
- adjustable.
- have effects on rain, snow, and flag.

8. BetterUI (behavior)
- when sitting in the cars, users are able to use mouse to change the view of field.

9. Fancy Hotel (two pairs of shaders, water, duck, snowman, spinning advertisement of gta 5, non-flat surface texturing, toon shading, curved surface)
- pool has water in it, and duck is floating above.
- duck will bump up and down according to the waves.
- the speed of water waves is adjustable.
- the clearance of water is adjustable.

10. Cloth simulation with textures
- 10 x 10 grid cloth simulation
- subdivision
- texture bind with curved surface
- wind system

11.Terrain rendering with multi texturing
- use height map to construct the terrain
- multi-texture
- fog

12.Rendering models from external sources
- draw meshes
- use blinn-phong shader
- deal with mesh - texture binding

13. User Interface
- a bunch of points of interest.
- various control sliders.
- well planned, thus is user-friendly.
